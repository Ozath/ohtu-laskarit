# 6. Retrospektiivitekniikat

Wikipedian mukaan retrospektiivi on “a meeting held by a project team at the end of a project 
or process (often after an iteration) to discuss what was successful about the project or time 
period covered by that retrospective, what could be improved, and how to incorporate the 
successes and improvements in future iterations or projects.”

The first retrospective named "Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel" is a quick (~10-25 min.) feeback gathering technique is used to figure out the pros and cons pertaining to the project (iteration, milestone, etc). An organizer places a poster with a circle divided into 5 parts labeled as per the name of the method. Participants give open feedback about the project pertaining to these categories, which is jotted down. The "Start" category for example depicts what the group should start doing, the "Stop" category depicts what the group should stop doing, etc. Larger groups can be subdivided and the same process carried out individually. Once no more contributions are given (wheel is full), then a brief discussion of its contents is carried out. Larger groups can first discuss amongst their subgroups and then merge the wheels and discuss further collectively. This should ideally lead to actions/changes being applied to further project tasks and milestones.

The second retrospective named "Glad, Sad, Mad" is a more lengthy (~60 min.) and indepth process. It is facilitated by a person (e.g. Scrummaster). The first step is for each participant to individually and briefly write down on index cards any issues or observations (pros and cons) pertaining to the previous sprint. These are then grouped according to the three labels that broadly depict positive and negative issues. This task is time-boxed at 10-15 min. The second step is for participants to describe their cards, in minimal detail so that group members understand the context, and place them on a whiteboard grouped into the three categories. An example negative (Sad) observation given is "JIRA task descriptions are not very clear". This is time-boxed at 10-15 min. One person then groups the cards together, with similar topics being adjacent. This should take no longer than 5 min. The third step is for all participants to vote on grouped issues to be discussed. This can be limited to N cards (e.g. normal limit 5) with each person simply marking the cards. This is time-boxed at 10 min. Then finally the facilitaror leads a discussion of the topics in descending order of the vote tally. The idea is to focus on actions that will improve the process in the next sprint. This ends when all issues have been discussed or 60 min. in total has passed.
