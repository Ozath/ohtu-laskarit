# 6. Retrospektiivitekniikat

Wikipedian mukaan retrospektiivi on “a meeting held by a project team at the end of a project 
or process (often after an iteration) to discuss what was successful about the project or time 
period covered by that retrospective, what could be improved, and how to incorporate the 
successes and improvements in future iterations or projects.”

# Lorem ipsum

The first retrospective Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel is a quick (~10 min.) feeback gathering technique to figure out the pros and cons (brainstorm) pertaining to the project (iteration, milestone, etc). An organizer places a poster with a circle divided into 5 parts labeled as per the name of the method. Participants give open feedback about the project pertaining to these categories, which is jotted down. The "Start" category for example depicts what the group should start doing, the "Stop" category depicts what the group should stop doing, etc. Larger groups can be subdivided and the same process carried out individually. Once no more contributions are given (wheel is full), then a brief discussion of its contents is carried out. Larger groups can first discuss amongst their subgroups and then merge the wheels and discuss further collectively. This should ideally lead to actions/changes being applied to further project tasks and milestones.
