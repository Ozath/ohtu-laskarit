# 6. Retrospektiivitekniikat

Wikipedian mukaan retrospektiivi on “a meeting held by a project team at the end of a project 
or process (often after an iteration) to discuss what was successful about the project or time 
period covered by that retrospective, what could be improved, and how to incorporate the 
successes and improvements in future iterations or projects.”

The first retrospective is a quick (~10-25 min.) brainstorming technique used to figure out pros and cons pertaining to a sprint. An organizer places a poster with a circle divided into 5 parts labeled as per the name of the method. Participants then give open feedback pertaining to these categories that is jotted down. The "Start" category for example depicts what the group should start doing. Once no more contributions are given, then a brief discussion of its contents is carried out. This should ideally lead to actions being applied to further sprints.

The second retrospective is a more lengthy (~60 min.) process. It is facilitated by a person (e.g. Scrummaster). First, each participant individually and briefly writes down on index cards any issues (pros and cons) pertaining to the previous sprint (~15 min). Then participants describe their cards in minimal detail and place them on a whiteboard according to the three labels as per the name of the method (~15 min). One person further groups the cards together, with similar topics being adjacent (~5 min). All participants vote on N issues to be discussed (~10 min.). A discussion of the issues in descending order of votes ensues with a focus on actions to improve the process in the next sprint. This ends when all issues have been discussed or 60 min. in total has passed.
